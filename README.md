This Heroku button is the simplest way to get a demo version of Heroku Connect.  Heroku Connect makes it easy for you to build Heroku apps that share data with your Salesforce deployment. Using bi-directional synchronization between Salesforce and Heroku Postgres, Heroku Connect unifies the data in your Postgres database with the contacts, accounts and other custom objects in the Salesforce database. Easily configured with a point and click UI, it’s simple to get the service up and running in minutes – no coding or complex configuration is required.

Please note that the demo version of Heroku Connect is limited to 10,000 total rows of data in your Salesforce objects and will be automatically paused if the sum of rows on the objects you're syncing is above 10,000. 

If you are not yet a Heroku verified account holder, clicking the Heroku button will prompt you to sign up for Heroku first.  After you verify your Heroku account, clicking the Heroku button will create an app, a database, and a demo instance of Heroku Connect.  Following the resulting link will guide you through final configuration in the Heroku Connect UI. Please make sure that you are in the intended Heroku app context, as you may not be defaulted to the new Heroku Connect app if you have multiple instances already running.
